# Welcome to the Joinup Page Layout Creator!

This tool provides Joinup content creators with templates of page layouts that they can freely use. It allows them to pick one or more of the predesigned layouts, copy and paste them in Joinup's content editor and finalise them by replacing the placeholder text and images with their own material.

## What's Joinup?

The [Joinup platform](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu) is the European Commission's one-stop shop for interoperable, open and free digital government ICT solutions, and an online space for sharing and learning about digital public services and initiatives.

## How to use the tool

The process is quite straightforward:

- Select one of the available templates
- Click on the `Copy to Clipboard` button
- Switch to your Joinup content editor, click the `Source` icon in the editor's toolbar
- Paste (`Ctrl-V`) you Clipboard's content in the editor's box
- Click the `Source` icon again to switch to preview mode
- Replace the placeholder text and images (just double-click an image) with your own material

## Joinup tips & tricks

You can be creative with only images and text. For example, after you've pasted a template in Joinup's editor keep in mind that:

- Images can act as buttons or graphical menu items (i.e. pointing to another of your pages) by hyperlinking them to URLs
- Tables can help you align your content if you need more complex layouts; i.e. centre a series of images, create a vertical list of items with logos/icons/images etc.
- If you need a horizontal divider, add a 2-row/1-column table and select the first row as a `header`
- If you're struggling with left-/right-aligning an embedded video (by default not allowed), use a 2-column table and place the video in one of the cells

## To do list

This is an early release, with very basic functionality and a limited selection of page layouts. Here's what will follow -- time permitting:

- Add more page layout templates
- Add ability to design your own page layouts and save as templates
- Allow you to add your text and images prior to copying to the Clipboard
